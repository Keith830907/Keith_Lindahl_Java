## Module Overview: Data Structures, Collections, and Exceptions
This module covers Java data structures, error handling, reading and writing structured data to and from files, and stream manipulation. Topics include:

1.	Collections
1.	Maps
1.	Exceptions
1.	Structured data and file I/O
1.	Lambdas and streams

## How This Relates to Previous Lessons
We've covered both non-object-oriented and object-oriented Java syntax and mechanics. Now we'll move on to collections, maps, and exception handling.
 We'll also cover basic file I/O and finish up with processing data using lambdas and streams. 

## Approach
This module is less theoretical than the previous one. Learners now know what classes, objects, and interfaces are and are ready to start using more complex
 Java data structures to build more complex programs. 

We start by covering collections and maps and showing learners how to use them to model, store, and manipulate more complex information.

We then move on to exception handling. Up to this point, we have concentrated on the "happy path" of our programs. More complex programs (and file I/O, which
 is covered in this module) lead to more complex error conditions that must be handled gracefully in production-quality code.

After we learn about exception handling, we combine collections, maps, exception handling, and file I/O to write programs that persist complex information
 to disk. This is an important feature in any useful program and the concepts presented here lead nicely into the relational database material presented later in the course.

Finally, we finish up with lambdas and streams. Lambdas and streams allow programmers to efficiently process complex data. We explain how to filter and transform
 data using these powerful tools.
