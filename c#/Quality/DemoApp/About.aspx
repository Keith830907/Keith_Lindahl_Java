     <p style= "text-align:center">​My previous business was called Quality, so everyone called me QJ or Quality John.  I have been in the service industry for over 20 years and I thrive to offer quality service. 
This is what “Quality” means to me… I have always taken pride in providing not average, not good, but excellent service, using the best equipment available, using the best methods
         available, and by receiving the best training available. </p>
